# leetcode-go
# A collection of leetcode solutions written in Go

The code samples saved here are my solutions to leetcode problems, done for fun and practice.  I've spent a lot of time building code where ease of maintenace and robustness were the focus and performance was of little concern.  Many of these problems call for efficient solutions so they are good practice for me.

These solutions are my own unless clearly marked.
